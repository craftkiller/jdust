  Java bindings to [[https://code.google.com/p/v8/][V8]] to render [[http://linkedin.github.io/dustjs/][Dustjs]] templates

  The purpose of this project is to facilitate faster compilation and
  rendering of Dustjs templates from a Java environment than was
  previously possible through the use of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino][Rhino]]. The goal of the
  project is to keep the native bindings as simple and safe as
  possible to keep the majority of the logic in Java.

* Status

  Currently this project is a work in progress. Not only is it not
  recommended for use in production environments but it also probably
  won't do anything you actually need it to do.
